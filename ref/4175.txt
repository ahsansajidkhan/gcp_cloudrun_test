<speaker:1> whatt they didn't say that in the thing
<speaker:2> that was weird
<speaker:1> publically distributed
<speaker:2> that was weird
<speaker:1> I didn't read that
<speaker:2> .
<speaker:1> well the was.
<speaker:2> okay well let's not talk about terrorism
<speaker:1> no Janice was talking to one of her friends and she said
<speaker:1> you know if you're going to get pregnant, you have to stop smoking dope
<speaker:2> ,
<speaker:1> that's not good
<speaker:1> did you see um- we rented that one of those Tom Clancy movies with Harrison Ford the one where he goes to Columbia did you see that one
<speaker:2> no no
<speaker:1> they had this little scene where the guys some guy in Columbia was using his cell phone, to call some other guy in Columbia
<speaker:2> huh
<speaker:1> and then you see this scene in Washington and then you see a bunch of antennas and radar dishes and stuff and then the guy starts talking and you see a a computer screen going on.
<speaker:1> deet deet deet deet deet deet
<speaker:1> voice identified
<speaker:1> voice, number blah blo blo blah
<speaker:1> you know so it'sthe nsalistening in t
<speaker:2> well the nsa guy that used to live upstairs doesn't live upstairs anymore
<speaker:1> he was an nsa guy
<speaker:2> he, well he used to work for them yeah
<speaker:1> what happened to Linda Lee
<speaker:2> she just left
<speaker:2> she left umph
<speaker:2> just I guess back in May
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:1> so she did her two years then she left
<speaker:2> well she left a little prematurely even
<speaker:1> hah
<speaker:2> she was
<speaker:2> she ended up not being too happy with her advisor
<speaker:1> I see
<speaker:1> what a surprise
<speaker:2> no she got married
<speaker:2> and
<speaker:2> they got married in March
<speaker:1> hah
<speaker:2> so she was sort ofeager to like
<speaker:2> like leave and
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> and move in with her husband
<speaker:2> um-
<speaker:1> I knew well I guess her husband was not from Pittsburgh
<speaker:2> and also she just.
<speaker:1> right
<speaker:2> no no
<speaker:2> it's the it's the same guy that-
<speaker:1> no
<speaker:2> she m-
<speaker:2> hhhactually met him
<speaker:2> right at the end of graduate school
<speaker:1> boy
<speaker:2> and uh-
<speaker:2> and um-
<speaker:2> somebody's at the door now
<speaker:2> Hi
<speaker:2> it's they're our upstairs neighbor just showed up at the door.
<speaker:2> yes so shemet him right before coming here
<speaker:1> hah
<speaker:2> so she like at the end of graduate school
<speaker:1> and they didn't break up
<speaker:2> they'd only been known each other like for like a couple of months
<speaker:2> like two months or something like that.
<speaker:2> and no they didn't break up
<speaker:1> my god
<speaker:2> and they continued as a long distance relationship for the whole time that she was here
<speaker:1> wow
<speaker:1> that's something
<speaker:2> so yeahh
<speaker:2> so then they got-
<speaker:2> they got married
<speaker:2> and she also she was not at all happy with her advisor
<speaker:1> yeah well
<speaker:2> hhhshe started talking aboutthings that really-
<speaker:2> rang a bell like-
<speaker:2> every week before going to the meeting with her-
<speaker:2> she'd be really scared and-
<speaker:2> every time she'dtell her her advisor would tell her to do something she'd have too uh-
<speaker:2> do it, and then come back to the meeting next weekand-
<speaker:2> her advisor xxx-
<speaker:2> who I still won't name in case this is being taped
<speaker:2> for
<speaker:1> hhhhhh
<speaker:2> psycholinguistics research
<speaker:1> hhhn
<speaker:2> xxx-
<speaker:1> that may be publically distrib-
<speaker:2> would uh-
<speaker:2> forget what she'd asked her to do the previous week and...
<speaker:2> you know-
<speaker:2> and it everything was-
<speaker:1> yeahand then if why didn't you do this
<speaker:2> everything was always harshly critical and never constructive and-
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> andso on so she was not very happy
<speaker:1> and and other things is like-
<speaker:1> wellwhat do youthink
<speaker:1> I mean is this better or is this better
<speaker:1> well why don't you consider all the possibilities and write me a report and
<speaker:2> .
<speaker:1> and then you write the report and-
<speaker:1> she says-
<speaker:1> well you knowin the report you said this was better so why don't you just do thathhh
<speaker:1> and it's like well the whole point of this whole thing
<speaker:2> .
<speaker:1> was to do what you thought
<speaker:1> .
<speaker:1> I already knew what I thought
<speaker:1> so why did I have to write this out
<speaker:2> .
<speaker:1> you know, yeah
<speaker:1> so you want to hear what my job is
<speaker:2> yes I do desperately
<speaker:1> okay I have a six month contract-
<speaker:2> hah
<speaker:1> I went to thish place and I said okay I want a
<speaker:1> this is like at Bell Corp basically
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> and I said you know I want to do HTI
<speaker:1> knowing full well that I had no idea what HTI was
<speaker:1> so they pegged me as a uh-
<speaker:1> as a an hti
<speaker:1> interface designer
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> you know, so I was thinking plus t plus i
<speaker:1> included you know-
<speaker:1> prototype testing where you go out and you test-
<speaker:2> sure yeah
<speaker:1> like-
<speaker:1> you know assessing user needs where you-
<speaker:1> you collect a lot of survey information
<speaker:1> and you analyze it with SPSS or whatever fh
<speaker:2> right yeah
<speaker:1> no no no no
<speaker:2> there's there's a leash
<speaker:1> no
<speaker:2> no no no
<speaker:1> interface design
<speaker:2> okay
<speaker:1> the guy who designs the interface
<speaker:1> and now I'm in group-
<speaker:1> there's half a dozen people
<speaker:2> huh
<speaker:1> and there are two guys
<speaker:1> who who go out and assess
<speaker:1> you know what what it is that the users want
<speaker:2> right
<speaker:1> and they do-
<speaker:1> one of the things they do is they show the video
<speaker:1> to the people and they had the-
<speaker:1> you know the thing that the republicans use
<speaker:2> hah
<speaker:1> you know when Reagan says something stupid people turn it to disapprove, and when he says something good they turn it to approve
<speaker:2> right, yeah yeah that little knob, yeah
<speaker:1> and so they yeah, and so they cut out all the disapproved stuff
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> well that's what they use
<speaker:2> wow
<speaker:1> they use that
<speaker:2> who are doing the software for
<speaker:1> are doing the a Bell Northern Research is a sub seduary of Northern Telecom
<speaker:2> huh
<speaker:1> which is a the main competitor to att for switching
<speaker:2> okay
<speaker:1> stuff
<speaker:2> okay
<speaker:1> and they also design telephones because you know
<speaker:1> what they do is they make people buy telephones-
<speaker:1> that you need all this bandwidth for-
<speaker:2> hm
<speaker:1> know the people buy the telephones, so then they-
<speaker:1> telephone company says well we have to buy all this extra switches and stuff that you.
<speaker:1> process the bandwidth
<speaker:1> so they have to buy more switches and that's where they make their money
<speaker:2> right, right
<speaker:1> they have a really cool telephone that's coming out now
<speaker:2> it's got a little l cd screen on it
<speaker:2> hm
<speaker:1> and you you can it's already out
<speaker:1> you know they have people have it in the office
<speaker:2> hm
<speaker:1> has an lcd screen
<speaker:1> it's about like eight
<speaker:1> rows by sixteen columns or twenty four columns
<speaker:1> or something
<speaker:2> that's not bad
<speaker:1> and you can you can like write people down in a directory
<speaker:1> and it'll say when they called
<speaker:1> and then it can leave, they can leave a little message, or-
<speaker:1> you know where you can hear the voice mail and-
<speaker:1> it can do telephone banking
<speaker:2> wow
<speaker:1> and all sorts order movies, whatever you want
<speaker:2> hm
<speaker:1> so that's their new thing, that they're coming out to-
<speaker:1> make people buy more switches
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> that's one of the things they ha-
<speaker:1> and they also have this-
<speaker:1> you know the Pennsylvania thing
<speaker:1> this is University of Pennsylvania
<speaker:2> what
<speaker:1> University of this phone stuff
<speaker:1> this phone recording
<speaker:2> yeah yeah
<speaker:1> they're the guys
<speaker:1> and it's William Labov
<speaker:1> if you might be familiar with him.
<speaker:2> sure
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> he's the one-
<speaker:1> who worked with them, the guys in montreal for this company
<speaker:1> and some other guys
<speaker:1> and in Quebec City I think
<speaker:2> hah
<speaker:1> to develop
<speaker:1> ,, to user
<speaker:1> no
<speaker:1> speaker independent
<speaker:1> speech recognition software
<speaker:2> wow
<speaker:1> and so I think that this.
<speaker:1> stuff that they're recording now is probably
<speaker:1> for that program that they're working with this company that I'm working for
<speaker:2> right, right.
<speaker:1> it's probably a continuation of that
<speaker:2> is Labov the same guy that did the cups-
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> this to the saucers
<speaker:1> yes
<speaker:2> or wasn't it was it cups to glasses or...
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:1> that's him
<speaker:1> he's a linguist
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> he only did that-
<speaker:1> you know from a linguistic point of view
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:2> and that was a long time ago, too
<speaker:1> yeah, thatwas nineteenseventy three
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> and uhhsso I think that they're continuing this and they they did this speech recognition thing it's pretty good
<speaker:1> you call up
<speaker:1> and it gives you the stock market report
<speaker:1> it asks you what company do you want to
<speaker:1> hear the stock market report for
<speaker:2> tsh ohso it's got afinite number of things it's gotta recognize in a way
<speaker:1> yeah about six thousand or
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> some-
<speaker:2> yeah yeah
<speaker:1> and you say I want a stock market report for Texaco
<speaker:1> and it Texaco up blah blah blah
<speaker:1> and it OR it asks you what exchange
<speaker:1> and you know, what do you want to hear
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> so it's like six thousand companies and about four or five parameters for each company
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> .
<speaker:1> hhhssso that's pretty cool
<speaker:1> .
<speaker:1> ts and uh-
<speaker:1> so that's the kind of stuff that they do
<speaker:1> and but my job, this is my job
<speaker:1> I have to make a Macromind Director movie
<speaker:1> that's my job
<speaker:2> really
<speaker:1> yep
<speaker:2> wow
<speaker:1> so it constitutes my whole job
<speaker:2> so what is it a movie of
<speaker:2> is it a movie like the interface in action or.
<speaker:1> well I can't tell you that's a secret
<speaker:1> but you know I'm going to have to put Quicktime stuff in there
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> and they want to tuhhh s speech recognition in there
<speaker:2> right
<speaker:1> so that they can do speech recognition
<speaker:1> so so it's going to have
<speaker:1> and it's going to be touch screen
<speaker:1> so the first thing xxxdo touch screen
<speaker:1> so I have to design
<speaker:1> the interface kind of like a problem space, you know
<speaker:2> right
<speaker:1> where every time they push a button is an operator
<speaker:2> right
<speaker:1> changes them to different state of the problem space
<speaker:2> right yup,
<speaker:1> .
<speaker:1> and so I have do a task analysis basically of...
<speaker:1> you know the little demo that I'm going to set up.
<speaker:1> it's kind of a demo
<speaker:1> it's not really necessarily a working thing
<speaker:2> yeah you know-
<speaker:1> I still have to look at the whole problem space
<speaker:1> and actually, this is weird
<speaker:1> yeah I was talking to a guy at-
<speaker:1> and I go to the local
<speaker:1> chi meetings computer human interaction group
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> a tm
<speaker:2> right
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> and I was talking to a guy who does HCI
<speaker:1> research at one of the universities here
<speaker:1> and I said
<speaker:1> and he was talking this machine that's really good for doing
<speaker:1> a software program that's really doing...
<speaker:1> really for doing finite state modelling
<speaker:1> he says.
<speaker:1> well you know we use for
<speaker:1> you know for human computer interaction designing
<speaker:1> you know rs for models that can use a finite rs
<speaker:1> you know that can be described by a finite state machine
<speaker:2> .
<speaker:1> and I'm thinking
<speaker:1> finite state machine isn't like the-
<speaker:1> a problem space
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> so Icome up and I ask him
<speaker:1> you knowbut he says and he's-
<speaker:1> going on and on you know
<speaker:1> what all my students my psychologist.
<speaker:1> you know students cause he teaches psychology
<speaker:1> they don't know anything about this, and they can't use it, and they're too dumb, and it'll just hhh-
<speaker:1> you know there's no way they'd understand this
<speaker:1> and I'm thinking wait
<speaker:1> isn't this problem space
<speaker:2> .
<speaker:1> so I go up, and I ask him after
<speaker:1> isn't this just problem space stuff
<speaker:1> and he said yeah
<speaker:1> and I said you know so why
<speaker:1> what's the problem then
<speaker:1> don't they all learn this in class
<speaker:1> and he saidhhh no psychologist knows that
<speaker:1> what are you talking about every psychologist
<speaker:2> no, maybe only at CMU
<speaker:1> yeah yeah so one of those CMU things
<speaker:2> yeahh
<speaker:1> totally
<speaker:1> so that's what it you know basically is
<speaker:1> human computer interaction
<speaker:1> they do a task analysis
<speaker:1> and then
<speaker:1> they write down the states and the operators
<speaker:1> on pieces of paper
<speaker:1> and then they go find someone and they say-
<speaker:1> you know, here's the here's the operators that you got
<speaker:1> go through the state
<speaker:1> and find the places where they have impasses
<speaker:1> and they fix them
<speaker:1> that's it
<speaker:2> right,
<speaker:1> that's about the total of it
<speaker:1> .
<speaker:2> right
<speaker:1> they don't even do a problem space analysis
<speaker:1> they do task analysis but they don't, try to figure out...
<speaker:1> what you know the subject's representation of of the task is
<speaker:2> right
<speaker:1> they don't even do that
<speaker:1> hhhso they don't evendo that yet
<speaker:1> so I'm saying that they were going to haveto do that
<speaker:1> so you knowas a psychologist if
<speaker:1> you know I'm building upmy own skills by.
<speaker:2> right
<speaker:1> a
<speaker:2> right
<speaker:1> but that's my job, I play around with Macromind Director and Quicktime xxx
<speaker:2> is it fun
<speaker:1> well I I only started this week this week they wanted to meet to write-
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> they wanted me to read some reports, of the data that was analyzed from the-
<speaker:1> the focus groups and the subjectsyou know with the littlething the little widget
<speaker:1> hhhhhhh
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> and watch some and
<speaker:1> and write down what functions I'm gonna implement in thething
<speaker:2> hm
<speaker:1> sso just that they would know you know this is what we're aiming for basically
<speaker:1> macromind director is complicated
<speaker:2> yeah that's what I've heard
<speaker:1> they even have like you know y-
<speaker:1> they even have stuff where you can write C code
<speaker:1> and that you can create an object and then port that in there
<speaker:1> and uhuse that inside Macromind Director
<speaker:1> so I might have to learn C plus plus
<speaker:2> yuck
<speaker:1> so I told them you know I said look
<speaker:1> you know I don't know how to program in C plus plus
<speaker:1> so if you have me do that
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> hhhyoubetter know that I don't know how to do that yet
<speaker:2> yeah yeah
<speaker:1> but so we'll see what happens
<speaker:1> the other guy's working on a project that'ssimilar to mine.
<speaker:1> he has to make a movie too
<speaker:1> but he's having all problems cause he needs to connect to a database
<speaker:1> and you he can't get a databasebecause he doesn't.
<speaker:1> know which database it connects too and
<speaker:1> he can't even get FTP
<speaker:1> he's not allowed to do FTP, cause they're all so security minded that you can't get FTP
<speaker:1> they won't give FTP to a student
<speaker:2> hmh
<speaker:1> you can't telnet, and uhthere's all this big stuff
<speaker:1> they don't seem to be very organized
<speaker:1> it's like CMU basically
<speaker:2> yeaheh
<speaker:1> you know
<speaker:1> it's like-
<speaker:1> you and me were
<speaker:1> the only difference is that nobody really steals programs
<speaker:2> right
<speaker:1> you know that's the only difference
<speaker:1> but the rest is-
<speaker:1> you know-
<speaker:1> you know we only have one manual, and the other guy's using it, so you have to learn it without the manual and
<speaker:1> hhhhhh you know basically that-
<speaker:1> it's all the same
<speaker:1> there's nobody you can call and say you know what program would I use with this
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> they don't know
<speaker:1> and nobody talks to each other, so you know it turns out that this other ggroup was doing the same thing
<speaker:1> and they have this whole interface that sits on top of Macromind Director
<speaker:1> that you can use to import uh-
<speaker:1> import objectsto it, and you know they didn't know that
<speaker:1> hm
<speaker:1> so it's kind of, Mark Shamian
<speaker:1> hey did you ever finishyour thesis
<speaker:2> yeah, i finished
<speaker:2> sort of
<speaker:1> sort Of
<speaker:2> well yeah i finished it, but i um-
<speaker:1> written it up for publica-
<speaker:2> no it's yeah it's it's written up
<speaker:2> I haven't handed in the actual
<speaker:2> xeroxes of it to the-
<speaker:2> to the um-
<speaker:2> public
<speaker:2> people you know
<speaker:2> like
<speaker:1> but you did hand it in they signed all the right no
<speaker:2> yeah, yeah
<speaker:1> okay
<speaker:1> that means you don't have to pay anymore
<speaker:2> right, yeah, I'm all done
<speaker:1> that's good
<speaker:2> and
<speaker:2> yeah I'm a-
<speaker:2> productive member of society finally I guess
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:1> yeah, well me too starting this wee-
<speaker:2> yeah great
<speaker:1> well I sent my thing in to Jay
<speaker:2> ha
<speaker:1> yeah and he said that he was going to read it
<speaker:2> great
<speaker:1> and told me what they cut out
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> it's a bit long
<speaker:2> how long
<speaker:1> over two hundred pages
<speaker:2> holy mackerel
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:1> and that's only with three pages of references, cause I lost the other ones
<speaker:2> jeez
<speaker:1> I didn't lose them but they were in another file
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> good to know,
<speaker:2> yeah I just saw Sean, Sean Vecera's
<speaker:2> hhhxxx defending on hishh.
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> xxx like a hundred and fifty pages or something like thatbut-
<speaker:1> that's pretty big
<speaker:2> yeah it looked really good it looked really professional, cause
<speaker:2> I figured probably already most of that
<speaker:2> or the box to publishkind of thing
<speaker:2> that it looked
<speaker:1> yeah then then he shouldn't of made it look good if it was published
<speaker:1> who cares
<speaker:1> well I guess that depends who's on your committee
<speaker:1> with Jay, you know cares
<speaker:2> yeah, Jay's on his committee
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> John
<speaker:1> well, put the glasses commit
<speaker:2> Yeah.
<speaker:1> Martha
<speaker:2> Martha yeah
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:1> well, she probably didn't care either
<speaker:2> long distance Martha
<speaker:2> yeah, I think he's just y know a real standup guy or whatever
<speaker:1> yeah.
<speaker:2> he's really workaholic and xxx-
<speaker:1> he got a job in Utah, right
<speaker:2> Utah
<speaker:1> I think so
<speaker:2> I can't remember
<speaker:1> Idaho
<speaker:1> Utah
<speaker:1> yeah, Utah
<speaker:1> cause he's near Idaho
<speaker:2> really
<speaker:1> wellyou find outyou can ask
<speaker:2> yeah, I'll find out
<speaker:1> Cathy Reid told me that he got a job in Utah
<speaker:1> and did Akira get a jobsomeplace in
<speaker:2> um-
<speaker:1> Colorado or-
<speaker:2> Colorado, yeah University of Colorado
<speaker:1> yeah that's where Cathy Reid is
<speaker:1> University of Colorado
<speaker:2> that's right yeah
<speaker:2> that's right
<speaker:1> she's at University of Denver
<speaker:1> not the University of Colorado
<speaker:2> they're close
<speaker:1> yeah they're close
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:1> so are you looking for a job
<speaker:2> no, I'm gonna stay here for another year
<speaker:2> in the
<speaker:1> you got money
<speaker:2> same job
<speaker:2> well we grant sort of.
<speaker:1> .
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> we just found out
<speaker:2> and we got-
<speaker:2> we got a really great priority score
<speaker:2> we're gonna get funded
<speaker:1> but you don't know how much
<speaker:2> yeah we'll probably get-
<speaker:2> probably get as much as they can give us
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> cause priority score's so high
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> but,
<speaker:1> until Newt gets a hold of it
<speaker:2> yeah right, that's one thing actually
<speaker:1> and-
<speaker:2> and then the other thing is that
<speaker:2> because it wasn't voted on until after July first
<speaker:2> now they're in the next fiscal year
<speaker:2> and they don't have to fund us until
<speaker:2> the following fiscal year
<speaker:2> or you some bureaucratic thing like that
<speaker:1> yeah yeah I got it
<speaker:2> so instead of getting funded October fifteenth
<speaker:2> hhhwe don't have to get fundeduntil
<speaker:2> the latest next October fifteenth or something like that
<speaker:1> I get it
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> so, an-
<speaker:1> and payment they don't have the appropriations for that year yet
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> they, they might not
<speaker:2> , they've basically.
<speaker:2> you know they sort of save it all up to the end of the year and thenblow it all at oncewhen they know exactly how much they've got and how much they have to spend
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> hhhhhh and we're hoping it's not gonna-
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> since we do have a good priority score we might be one of the ones they fund on time
<speaker:1> well I hope you didn't name your proposal you know nimh proposal number thirty six
<speaker:1> they-
<speaker:1> the last time they killed a bunch of proposals, they killed that one
<speaker:2> aah
<speaker:1> the one that had no title
<speaker:1> it got killed
<speaker:1> so
<speaker:2> ya know we had a name I can't remember what it is.
<speaker:2> but I'm sure it was impressive
<speaker:1> the important thing to have is a good title like-
<speaker:1> really really really good crucial research
<speaker:1> that won't get any Republicans unelected
<speaker:2> .
<speaker:1> that's what you should called it
<speaker:2> hhhhhh unfortunately it is have to having to do with mental health and stuff
<speaker:2> it's more likely to get cut than
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> normal like you know
<speaker:2> how people
<speaker:2> shoot down missileskinda
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> .
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> Republican thing
<speaker:1> that's right yeah
<speaker:1> well you know another one that they they cut
<speaker:1> and this was thetheguy at Byrd this was from West Virginia
<speaker:2> a ha
<speaker:1> they really hated one that was called an indepth study of Senate elections.
<speaker:1> cut that one out and
<speaker:2> hhhhhhhhh
<speaker:1> it's true they did actually thatone
<speaker:1> and,
<speaker:1> yes
<speaker:1> so all the big guys you know, got together no we don't wanna find out you know
<speaker:2> ghh
<speaker:1> they don't want them digging in to our closets
<speaker:1> hhhtotally obvious
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:2> hhhhhhh
<speaker:1> so I Janice is pregnant
<speaker:2> yeAH
<speaker:1> and the kid's due on Halloween,
<speaker:2> halloween
<speaker:1> yeah-
<speaker:1> we're hoping it's on Halloween
<speaker:1> that would be way cool
<speaker:1> yeah we could name it like
<speaker:2> no but it-
<speaker:1> or something
<speaker:2> but it wouldn't be that great for the kid cause like
<speaker:2> they they couldn't have a birthday party.
<speaker:2> every year the other kids would be going to Halloween
<speaker:1> yeah yeah we could do it like
<speaker:1> the next weekbut it'snot as bad as yeah being born on Chrismas day, which is total garbage
<speaker:2> no, no, yeah
<speaker:1> or even close to Christmas like you know if you're born on January tenth
<speaker:2> right
<speaker:1> you know that's-
<speaker:1> nobody's going to buy you another-
<speaker:2> it's a real let down
<speaker:1> yeah so Halloween's not bad
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> not bad
<speaker:1> call him Damien or something like-
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:1> so how's it going in general
<speaker:1> you liking your job or
<speaker:2> yeah it's all right, um-
<speaker:1> getting any publications
<speaker:2> no
<speaker:1> no
<speaker:2> no it's kind of it's kind of dead end job as far as that goes
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> if we'd gotten funding early
<speaker:2> there was money in it, for me to become like a real post doc instead of a slave
<speaker:1> yeah that's remember you said that
<speaker:2> yeah, but until we get that money I'm still just a slave
<speaker:2> I guess I gotta
<speaker:1> right
<speaker:2> you know, run the show
<speaker:1> yeah.
<speaker:2> and, hhhi did get, i did actually get one third author conference proceeding publication so far but, you know not all that impressive
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> hhhxxx
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:2> doing
<speaker:1> it seems obvious
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:2> I thought about that
<speaker:1> you don't only apply to one place
<speaker:2> yeahI thought about that, definitely
<speaker:1> so,
<speaker:1> you know, making Macromind Directormovies, xxx
<speaker:1> it's not genius work
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> but they also
<speaker:1> I think one of the reasons they hired me is because they're also concerned about
<speaker:1> about the behavioral implications the future web stuff is going to be like
<speaker:2> right
<speaker:1> so they might be interested in me for those reasons
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> hhhbut I'm really not hired for that I'm in-
<speaker:1> I'm in o k thirteen
<speaker:1> which is user interface design
<speaker:1> right in there
<speaker:1> i saw this talk with this lunatic woman who is
<speaker:1> I you know i gotta contracting job, I don't have like a permanent job
<speaker:1> hhhbut thislunatic woman who's applying for a permanent job that they have
<speaker:2> hah
<speaker:1> this is what she did
<speaker:2> this is one of the things she did
<speaker:2> and she did in more than one domain
<speaker:2> she went to England
<speaker:2> because she couldn't
<speaker:2> she didn't know how to speak English so she wanted to learn
<speaker:2> she's Brazilian
<speaker:2> so she goes to England
<speaker:1> hah
<speaker:1> to the Manchester Advanced Technical Research Institute or something
<speaker:2> hah,
<speaker:1> and tell her well you know you do whatever you as long as it's medical it's gotta be something medical
<speaker:1> cause they had, you know guessing they had the medical funding for her
<speaker:2> hah
<speaker:1> so she goes she goes around to hospitals
<speaker:1> and she pokes around the hospitals'n'stuff
<speaker:1> and she starts
<speaker:1> you knowone of the things that she does is she watches surgery
<speaker:1> and
<speaker:1> this woman she has,
<speaker:1> an ergonomics background, a biomechanics background
<speaker:1> an industrial design background and production
<speaker:2> a hah
<speaker:1> engineering background people who study
<speaker:1> how you goods in manufacturingand.
<speaker:1> andfix your production techniques
<speaker:1> and she she has like one or two phds
<speaker:2> okaY
<speaker:1> I can't remember
<speaker:1> hhhhhhh she looks at the surgeons, and the surgeons
<speaker:1> and this is really weird, you'd think it wouldn't be like this.
<speaker:1> but their surgical instruments are basically out of the eighteen hundreds
<speaker:1> and they haven't changed for a hundred and fifty years
<speaker:1> and so they're using one like
<speaker:1> you know one of the examples she had that was really
<speaker:1> horrible, it was really disgraceful it's like this
<speaker:1> is a needle holderand you know they don't-
<speaker:1> they don't hold the needles with their hands they hold the needle with a little needle holder
<speaker:1> .
<speaker:2> a ha
<speaker:1> but the needle holder looks like a short scissor
<speaker:1> like the kind of scissor that you'd cut your nails with you know
<speaker:1> so it's got a little short blades but they're not blades cause they hold the needle
<speaker:1> and it's got one handle's longer than the other
<speaker:1> so you figure they put their thumb and their finger through the handle and they you know
<speaker:1> do that
<speaker:1> they don't
<speaker:1> they don't put any finger through either of the holes
<speaker:2> what d' they do
<speaker:1> they take the long handle
<speaker:1> and they put they jam their little finger
<speaker:1> right above the hole, right above the loop
<speaker:1> and they
<speaker:1> they put their thumb
<speaker:1> along the small handle
<speaker:1> don't put their thumb through the hole either.
<speaker:1> then they take their index finger and they extend it forward
<speaker:1> to where the screw is
<speaker:2> okay
<speaker:1> you know the screw that holds the two parts together
<speaker:2> right
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> and they kind of like
<speaker:1> guide the whole thing with their index finger
<speaker:1> hhhand they sort of hold it like a gun.
<speaker:2> I see yeah okay not-
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> yeah, okay
<speaker:1> with their index finger stuck out, and that's how they do it
<speaker:1> of coursebecause of the shape of the thing.
<speaker:1> they also turn their halfway upside down
<speaker:2> .
<speaker:1> and bend their backs so that theirmm heads are.
<speaker:1> over the patient.
<speaker:1> and basically the whole posture's just totally shit.
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> and theirthese guys probably get carpel tunnel syndrome after three operations, wrists
<speaker:2> right yeah
<speaker:1> horrIble
<speaker:1> they had pictures of how they were holding them and it was like
<speaker:1> hhhhhh my god
<speaker:1> hhso anyway she said all surgical instruments are like that, they all suck
<speaker:2> really
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:1> so this is what she didshe videotaped them
<speaker:1> she had
<speaker:1> fifty six thousand frames of videotape
<speaker:1> from that she selected three hundred and forty frames
<speaker:1> that best represented that gave her good shots you know where you could see where the guyswere allbent out of shape
<speaker:1> so then she did, for thirty six instruments
<speaker:1> she decided to redesign thirty six instruments
<speaker:1> for generally for surgical instruments she did a historical analysis
<speaker:1> so she looked you know where the surgical instruments come from
<speaker:1> and the reason they all look like scissors is
<speaker:1> because they were barbers, barbers were surgeons
<speaker:2> right that's right
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> they all look like that
<speaker:1> and they haven't changed since eighteen
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> fifty eight
<speaker:2> that's incredible
<speaker:2> I didn't know that
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:1> and
<speaker:2> thought there was a good reason for that
<speaker:2> you know
<speaker:1> there is no goodxxx good reasons is that people are stupid
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> that's the reason nobody's done it before
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> so she did prototypes
<speaker:1> like for the needle the needle holder
<speaker:2> aha,
<speaker:1> she did like forty prototypes of that
<speaker:1> pencil she did a paper prototype, where she took pictures of how the person would hold it from an ergonomics perspective
<speaker:2> .
<speaker:2> right
<speaker:1> and she analyzed all the hand movements, as a function of that, and she had this
<speaker:1> ergonomicists have this little you know biometrical chart
<speaker:1> so drew all the hand movements on the biometrical chart for each instrument
<speaker:1> and for each prototype that she well
<speaker:1> for each class of prototype that she was developing
<speaker:2> right
<speaker:1> and then she did paper prototypes and took pictures
<speaker:1> how you would hold itwith you know with your hand over a measuring instrument
<speaker:2> right.
<speaker:1> rulers and coordinatespaceso that you you could map it out
<speaker:1> then she did plastic prototypes
<speaker:1> then she did metal prototypes
<speaker:1> and she had the you which one of the metal they wanted
<speaker:1> hhhand of course the metal prototypes are designed based on ergonomic perspective you know so you don't have to bend your wrist and all this garbage
<speaker:1> and so the surgeons tried those out
<speaker:1> and they said yeah this is great you know let's make some of these and we want to buythese thingshhh
<speaker:1> so then she goes to-
<speaker:1> manufacturer to how they manufacture surgicalinstruments
<speaker:1> and this is how they do it
<speaker:1> they have molds andthey pour the gunk into molds
<speaker:1> then they take it out of molds, and they have these guys filing it down, filing all the burrs off by hand
<speaker:1> and bending all the pieces by hand
<speaker:1> okay, so it's basically a hand job handcrafted
<speaker:1> so she redesigns the production process
<speaker:1> to use strips of metal instead
<speaker:2> .
<speaker:1> that can be bent, you know by a machine rather than by some guy
<speaker:2> right
<speaker:2> right
<speaker:1> and since she's using cutting strips of metal off
<speaker:1> you know you can polish them and stuff you don't need to to shave the burrs off.
<speaker:1> .
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> so she redesigns the whole production process for each of her instruments.
<speaker:1> and then they're sort of the companies were starting to do market testing for this
<speaker:1> and she left
<speaker:1> she left England
<speaker:1> so you know, she was done so she left
<speaker:2> yeah, right
<speaker:1> and she also did this, she did this same thing
<speaker:1> for like other domains
<speaker:1> she measured people's she's from Brazil, and she measured
<speaker:1> the size, the, the, she did basically a dimensional measuring
<speaker:1> of five hundred pairs of feet
<speaker:2> okay
<speaker:1> and to do this
<speaker:1> she had to design and build herself
<speaker:1> her own measuring station that had thirty different devices
<speaker:1> 'kay
<speaker:1> and she also took footprints, like you know on ink
<speaker:1> hhhand she had to design her ownplastic, rubber thing for that
<speaker:2> right
<speaker:1> and so she mapped all of that out and she looked at the history of shoes, and
<speaker:1> then she went to some factory and
<speaker:1> and redesigned their shoe, you know
<speaker:1> their leather cutting process so that they would save more leather
<speaker:1> and they woulduse less leather
<speaker:1> .
<speaker:1> and so that
<speaker:1> junior leather cutters were as good as you know expert leather cutters
<speaker:2> right
<speaker:1> hhhand so now they're using this technique to make their shoes
<speaker:2> wow
<speaker:1> and uhshe did like, you know three or four otherthings like this
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:1> so it's justtotal she's a total lunatic
<speaker:1> basicallyshe's like
<speaker:1> you know she's her own vertically integrated manufacturing
<speaker:2> yeah
<speaker:1> corporation
<speaker:2> right, yeah
<speaker:1> I don't know if they're going to hire her though but, it was just ridiculous
<speaker:1> hhhand she said she has a book
<speaker:2> wow
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> in Brazil
<speaker:1> no actually it was I don't know what it was written in but when she went to England they wanted itbut it was out of print they.
<speaker:2> , okay.
<speaker:1> they were already on the second edition was already out of print
<speaker:2> aha
<speaker:1> hhso
<speaker:1> I don't knowI don't know if they're going to hire her, but I guess I would hire her but I don'tknow
<speaker:2> yeah, right
<speaker:1> Janice says hi
<speaker:2> hi
<speaker:2> Linda says hi
<speaker:2> .
<speaker:1> that's good Hi Linda
<speaker:2> actually I was going to go to the bathroom real quick
<speaker:2> do you want to talk to Linda for a bit about police
<speaker:1> sure
<speaker:2> problem
<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:2> she might actually have, you know, reference sources that
<speaker:2> hhhshe could point you to or find out an answer for.
<speaker:2> .
<speaker:1> that would be good, yeah
<speaker:2> yes
<speaker:3> Canadian law
<speaker:2> not Canadian law American law xxx it's
<speaker:2> here I'll put her on, and I'll be right back.
<speaker:1> okay

<speaker:1> yeah
<speaker:3> and I I gather that it's a projector
<speaker:1> yeah, something, I think they're just gonna, they're just getting a lot of speech so that they can, hhhyou know try to have a a system learn be able to recognize, different words from different speakers
<speaker:3> yeah
<speaker:1> xxx-
<speaker:3> hhhhhh how is everything
<speaker:3> you a legal problem
<speaker:2> I would rather talk about the baby problemhhh.
